# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

Bug reports, pull requests, and ideas are welcome. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/cyclejs-community/cyclejs-community/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md), so please give it a read if you haven't already.

## On to the technical stuff. Here's how to make add a feature, or fix a bug
1. Have a quick read of the [open and closed issues](https://github.com/cyclejs-community/cycle-mouse-driver/issues) and make sure your problem hasn't already been dealt with.
2. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/cyclejs-community/cycle-mouse-driver/fork) and clone it down.
3. Create your feature branch `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
4. Commit your changes `git commit -m 'Add my new feature'`
5. Run the tests to make sure you haven't broken any `npm run test`
6. Push to the branch `git push origin my-new-feature`
7. Create a new Pull Request

One or more of the contributors will give you feedback. If you don't hear anything within a week, please tag someone or bump the issue by commenting again. Give it a few days though, sometimes people get busy and can't give useful and constructive feedback immediately. Thanks for your understanding on that :+1:

## I have an idea, or some feedback, but I don't necessarily want to contribute code
That's fantastic! Thank you for taking the time to help us improve, and offering your perspective. Please take a look through the [open and closed issues](https://github.com/cyclejs-community/cycle-mouse-driver/issues), and if there isn't one there that addresses your idea or feedback already, make a new issue. If you don't hear anything for a week, bump the issue by commenting again and maybe tag a contributor.
