# [Cycle Mouse Driver](http://cyclejs-community.github.io/cycle-mouse-driver)

A driver for Cycle.js to help you deal with mouse events in your application

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install cycle-mouse-driver --save
```
Cycle Mouse Driver is stream library agnostic. You should be able to use it with RxJs, xstream, or whatever you like. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/cyclejs-community/cycle-mouse-driver/issues) if you have any troubles, and note which stream library you are using.

## Usage

- Install Cycle Mouse Driver with npm (see above)

- Import the driver

```js
import {makeMouseDriver} from 'cycle-mouse-driver';
```

- Initialise the driver by calling `makeMouseDriver()` in your drivers object

```js
const drivers = {
  Mouse: makeMouseDriver()
}
```

- Add it to your main function's sources

```js
function main({Mouse}) { /* Your amazing main function */ }
```

## Methods
- `up()`: returns a stream of mouseup events

- `down()`: returns a stream of mousedown events

- `click()`: returns a stream of click events

- `positions()`: returns a stream of all mousemove events as a vector with an x and a y position.

```js
const mousePosition$ = Mouse.positions();
const mouseUp$ = Mouse.up();
```

## Example

**[Try this example online](http://cyclejs-community.github.io/cycle-mouse-driver)**

```javascript
import {run} from '@cycle/xstream-run';
import {makeDOMDriver, div, h1, h3} from '@cycle/dom';
import {makeMouseDriver} from 'cycle-mouse-position'
import xs from 'xstream';

export default function main({DOM, Mouse}){
  const mousePosition$ = Mouse.positions();

  return {
    DOM: mousePosition$.map(pos =>
      div(
        '.container', [
          h1('Where\'s my mouse at? üê≠'),
          h3(`X: ${pos.x}, Y: ${pos.y}`)
        ]
      )
    )
  }
}

const drivers = {
  DOM: makeDOMDriver('.app'),
  Mouse: makeMouseDriver()
};

run(app, drivers);
```
